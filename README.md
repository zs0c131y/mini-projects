# Mini Projects

This repository contains mini projects that I have worked on, which are helpful but not so significant to get an entire repo for them. This README file will list projects that I have created in different languages, but mainly Python, JavaScript, C.

This readme file will be updated as I create more projects and is used for an overview. For detailed project readme, please see the specific language folder. Each language folder lists the projects and their respective descriptions in a single readme for accessibility.
